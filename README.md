# To Use IT.

To use this code, you will need the compilator of C++ and also you will need a IDE. 

To see in your computer if you got the compilator use this command in the CMD (g++ --version).

# TO INSTALL COMPILATOR

In this web (https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#mingw-w64-builds) , you must install the correct for your SO.

In my case i have W11 with x64 soo i will install (https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases) the file (x86_64-15.1.0-release-posix-seh-msvcrt-rt_v12-rev0.7z)

Then you need to extract the file , you need to go to the rute of the folder you extract. In this folder you are going to have another folder called bin. Copy the rute of this folder. When you got this go to the control panel (In Windows).  And you need to go to System/Edit the system environment variables and click in the button called Environment Variables. 

Make Click in PATH, IMPORTANT!!! Dont delete any row here, just add a new with the rute of the folder we copy, soo click in new and paste the rute. 

Close all (Also the CMD) and with the same command (g++ --version) it will show you the version of C++ installed.
